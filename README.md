# You Should Know DS (Data Structures)
Welcome to You Should Know DS codebase!
This repo focuses on popular data structures in computer science like arrays, linked lists and trees. The codebase is entirely written in JavaScript.

## What's in this repository?
As of now, it contains the following sections:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked lists
- Trees
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees
- Misc 

## Why this repository?
Data structures and algorithms are an integral part of computer science and as a developer (frontend/backend), knowledge of the most popuplar data structures is a must. Knowing how to implement data structures and solving programming questions helps one gain confidence in coding as well as in understanding the language. The biggest benefit being becoming a better problem solver.

This repo contains the basic implementation details of these data structures in JavaScript and also the code for frequently asked questions during interviews. 

So far, the reference point for most of the questions in this repo is GeeksForGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/). 

## More about the name
Being a web developer, my go-to rescource for diving deep into JavaScript is the very famous book series - You Don't Know JS by Kyle Simpson. The name of the book is intriguing as it challenges you to know more about the parts of JavaScript which are baffling. This book is a must-read for beginners as well as experienced developers to know more about the nitty-gritties of the language. 
Just as essential JS is to a web developer, DS too is essential in becoming a better developer. Hence the name, <b> You Should Know DS </b>.
